Template 1. Recursion
The advantage of the recursion solution is that it is easier to implement. 
However, there is a huge disadvantage: if the depth of recursion is too high, you will suffer from stack overflow.

/*
 * Return true if there is a path from cur to target.
 */
boolean DFS(Node cur, Node target, Set<Node> visited) {
    return true if cur is target;
    for (next : each neighbor of cur) {
        if (next is not in visited) {
            add next to visited;
            return true if DFS(next, target, visited) == true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Template 2. Explicit stack

/*
 * Return true if there is a path from cur to target.
 */
boolean DFS(int root, int target) {
    Set<Node> visited;
    Stack<Node> stack;
    add root to stack;
    while (stack is not empty) {
        Node cur = the top element in stack;
        remove the cur from the stack;
        return true if cur is target;
        for (Node next : the neighbors of cur) {
            if (next is not in visited) {
                add next to visited;
                add next to stack;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
